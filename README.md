# typescript-express-web-server

This is Typescript Express Web server that can be used as a starter kit for web development, initially forked from [velotio-tech](https://github.com/velotio-tech/typescript-express-web-server).

Need to update somewhat to more match structure and patterns of [this project](https://github.com/alexpermiakov/node-rest-api/tree/step.16.1)
